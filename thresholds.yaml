# RefactoringHealthEngine Thresholds Configuration
# This file contains configurable thresholds for refactoring evaluation
# Values can be adjusted per project to optimize fake improvement detection

# Risk and maintainability score tolerance (Â±N points)
# Accounts for measurement errors and minor variations
riskDiffTolerance: 2
maintainDiffTolerance: 2

# Complexity reduction requirements by intent
complexityReduction:
  cleanup: 5        # cleanup requires 5%+ complexity reduction
  split: 0          # split allows neutral complexity (may redistribute)
  extend: -5        # extend tolerates 5% complexity increase for new features
  rename: 0         # rename expects no complexity change
  extract: 0        # extract focuses on maintainability over complexity

# Function explosion scoring
functionExplosion:
  baseThreshold: 0.1      # Base explosion threshold (10%)
  slopeCoefficient: 0.05  # Adjustment factor for function size: 0.05 * log10(LOC)
  maxThreshold: 0.5       # Maximum allowed explosion threshold

# Maintainability improvement requirements by intent
maintainabilityImprovement:
  cleanup: 10       # cleanup should improve maintainability by 10+ points
  split: 0          # split neutral on maintainability
  extend: -5        # extend can reduce maintainability slightly
  rename: 5         # rename should improve maintainability
  extract: 15       # extract should significantly improve maintainability

# Risk score improvement requirements by intent
riskImprovement:
  cleanup: 10       # cleanup should reduce risk by 10+ points
  split: 0          # split neutral on risk
  extend: -10       # extend can increase risk slightly
  rename: 0         # rename should not affect risk
  extract: 5        # extract should reduce risk moderately

# Evaluation modes
evaluation:
  useLocalMode: true          # Use local evaluation for target functions
  useGlobalMode: false        # Use global evaluation for entire project
  requireSignificantChange: true  # Require statistically significant changes
  statisticalThreshold: 0.05  # p-value threshold for significance testing
