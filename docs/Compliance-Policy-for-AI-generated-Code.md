# Compliance Policy for AI-Generated Code

This document defines the internal compliance policy for all code generated by AI.  
Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Violations will result in immediate rejection or revision requests.

## 🔒 Mandatory Rules

1. **Coding Standards**
   - All code MUST strictly adhere to our defined coding standards.
   - Any deviation is considered a compliance violation and will result in rejection.

2. **Quality Control**
   - Every piece of generated code MUST undergo a quality control evaluation.
   - Skipping, bypassing, or omitting quality checks is strictly prohibited.

3. **Export Rules**
   - Default exports are strictly prohibited. Use named exports only.

4. **File Naming**
   - The output file name MUST match the specified name exactly. Do not invent or modify names arbitrarily.

5. **Type Safety**
   - All function arguments and return types MUST be explicitly typed.

## ✅ Confirmation Procedure (MANDATORY)

Before generating any code, you MUST:

1. Repeat the rules above, either verbatim or in summarized form.
2. Confirm your understanding and agreement by stating:

> “I have read, understood, and will fully comply with the Compliance Policy for AI-generated Code.”

Only after this confirmation may code generation begin.

These rules are non-negotiable and must be enforced at all times.
