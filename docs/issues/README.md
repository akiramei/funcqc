# Known Issues

This directory contains detailed documentation of known issues in funcqc.

## üö® Critical Issues

### [DCD-001: Dead Code Detection Accuracy Problems](./dead-code-detection-accuracy.md)
**Status**: Identified - Needs Fix  
**Impact**: High - Critical functions incorrectly marked as dead code  
**Affected**: `funcqc dead`, `funcqc clean` commands  

**Quick Summary**: Dead code detection has false positives. Functions actively used in tests and source files are incorrectly identified as dead code, leading to potential deletion of critical functions.

**Before Using**: Always verify dead code results manually and use `--dry-run` before deletion.

### [DCD-002: Dead Code Detection Accuracy Improvements Implementation](./dead-code-detection-improvements.md)
**Status**: In Progress  
**Impact**: High - Systematic implementation to resolve DCD-001  
**Affected**: `funcqc dead`, `funcqc clean` commands  

**Quick Summary**: Implementation plan for systematic improvements to dead code detection accuracy through 3-phase approach: entry point detection enhancement, same-file call detection, and module resolution enhancement.

**Progress**: Phase 1 (Entry Points) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Internal Calls) ‚Üí Phase 3 (Module Resolution)
